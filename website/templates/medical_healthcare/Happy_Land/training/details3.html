										HTML : HyperText Markup Language
										<!--<a ng-click="isCollapsed=!isCollapsed">-->

										HTML  is the standard markup language used to create web pages.[1]Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a websitesemantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

										The language is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>). Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

										HTML can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. Web browsers can also refer to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material. 
									</div>
									
									<div id="cssdetail3" class="collapse well">
										CSS : Cascading Style Sheets 
										CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
										CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.
									</div>
									
									<div id="css3detail3" class="collapse well">
										CSS3 ANIMATIONS : 

										CSS3 Animations allows animation of most HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!
										An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want. To use CSS3 animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

										The @keyframes Rule
										When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times. To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.
									</div>
									
									<div id="html5detail3" class="collapse well">
										HTML 5 :
										In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactic features. These include the
										new &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt; elements, as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content (replacing generic &lt;object&gt; tags), and MathML for mathematical formulas. These features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to resort to proprietary plugins and APIs. Other new page structure elements, such as &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;,&lt;article&gt;,&lt;header&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;figure&gt;, are designed to enrich the semantic content of documents. Newattributes have been introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed and some elements, such as &lt;a&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;and &lt;menu&gt; have been changed, redefined or standardized. The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification.[6] HTML5 also defines in some detail the required processing for invalid documents so that syntax errors will be treated uniformly by all conforming browsers and other user agents
									</div>
									
									<div id="jsdetail3" class="collapse well">
										JAVASCRIPT :
										An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

										JavaScript  is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.  It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. 

										Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies ofWorld Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins.
										JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
										 It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
									</div>
									
									<div id="lessdetail3" class="collapse well">
										LESS CSS :
										Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. Less runs inside Node, in the browser and inside Rhino.
